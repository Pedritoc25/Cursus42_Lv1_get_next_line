Necromancy spells are those that can manipulate life itself.
As this is a somewhat broad umbrella, the Necromancy school is quite varied, featuring spells that can raise the dead or deal serious damage to one's enemies.
In regards to magic capable of raising the dead, spells like Revivify and Raise Dead can bring a creature back from the dead, good as new, while spells like Animate Dead and Danse Macabre can be used to create undead.
Due to the life-manipulating nature of this school, nearly each of its damaging spells deals necrotic damage.
It should also be noted that this school is home to effects that can plague another creature with detrimental effects such as Blindness/Deafness, Bestow Curse, and Ray of Enfeeblement.
